# Actions are determined by evaluating the request method, for example a PUT request translates to an 'update' action, POST to an 'create' action.
# In combination with the target_type_uri this represents sufficient information to enable basic rate limit and audit.
# However, more granularity might be required.
# This can be achieved by defining actions using the below configuration.

# Per default a GET ../servers/detail request would be action=read, target_type_uri=compute/servers/detail
# The below configuration for the same request would produce: action=read/list/detail, target_type_uri=compute/servers/detail
custom_actions:
  servers:
    detail: read/list
    # The request POST ../servers/<server_id>/action with body { "addFloatingIp": ... } would produce: action=create, target_type_uri=compute/servers/addFloatingIp
    # The below configuration modifies the action to: action=update/add/floatingip
    action:
      addFloatingIp: update/addFloatingIp
      removeFloatingIp: update/removeFloatingIp

  flavors:
    detail: read/list
    action:
      addTenantAccess: add/project-access
      removeTenantAccess: remove/project-access
